1. Backend:
- Managed to implement the basic server to publish and receive a data stream using MQTT server
- Did completely implement the server API, will have to take a couple of days from sprint 2 to complete the work.

2. Mobile application:
- Considered a stream API, but because of the disadvantages with the architecture decided to move forward with MQTT.
- Implemented a prototype on NodeJS but could not make the application to run on a mobile. Will have to take a couple of days from sprint 2 to complete the mobile app.
