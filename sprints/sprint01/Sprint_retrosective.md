1. Backend Server:
- We first tried to make a REST only API, but later figured out that the structure is not suitable for our project. So we switched to a REST + MQTT structure and we will be moving forward with this approach.

2. Mobile Application:
- We worked with the assumption that React native (framework used to write the mobile app) will have the same dependencies and modules of NodeJS, but later figured out that it is no the case. We will have to figure out how to overcome dependency issues during the next sprint.
